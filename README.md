# VBScared Tool ðŸ’€

VBScared is an executable, disguised as a .jpg file, that executes a VBScript in-memory reverse shell upon double clicking. The executable can be delivered to victims via social engineering tactics.

## Compile resources

```
windres resources\resources.rc -O coff --target pe-i386 -o resources\resources.res
```

Wait for a connection ;).
